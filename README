Shoebill - a Macintosh II emulator that can only run A/UX


See the wiki on https://code.google.com/p/shoebill for better
documentation on building and running Shoebill.

*** RUNNING ***

You will need
* OS X and a 64-bit Intel Macintosh
  (32-bit builds may be possible in the future)
* A Macintosh II or IIx ROM
* A disk image with A/UX 1.x.x or 2.x.x installed
* The kernel on that image (/unix). Shoebill can’t read
  SVFS or UFS file sytems yet to load the kernel directly
  from the disk image.


To boot A/UX
* Backup your disk images!!
  When Shoebill inevitably crashes, your A/UX boot image
  will very likely be corrupted - sometimes so severely 
  that A/UX can’t even boot enough to run fsck.
* Open Shoebill.app and select Preferences menu item
  * Set the paths for your ROM, kernel, and disk image(s).
  * Do use SCSI ID #0 for your A/UX boot image.
  * Give A/UX a reasonable amount of RAM - say, 32MB
  * Press “Apply and Run”  


*** BUILDING ***

1) cd to shoebill/
2) make # to build shoebill_core
3) xcodebuild -project gui/Shoebill.xcodeproj # to build the Cocoa GUI
